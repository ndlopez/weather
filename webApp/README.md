# Weather Application

This repository is mostly for learning purposes (PHP in particular).

Weather data scraped from [tenki.jp](www.tenki.jp) because of HTML format. Other options are Yahoo!Tenki and WeatherNews. The first one, is not nicely formatted and difficult to scrape. Probably using its API will be better... but as I saw it, once requested it only returns the data for the current hour. The second one, is actually easy to scrape, I will probably add such script later on.
